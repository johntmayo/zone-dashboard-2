Context handoff:
Please read `DATA_PROBLEM_HANDOFF.md` in this repo first and use it as source of truth.

Current status:
- High-risk row mismatch bug has been fixed and manually verified.
- `Add Record` is intentionally disabled right now.
- We need to continue with staged validation and safe re-enable.

What I need you to do now:
1) Verify current code state matches handoff:
   - `index.html` has `ENABLE_ADD_RECORD = false`
   - Add Record button is hidden/inaccessible
   - row identity logic uses stable absolute row mapping
   - address-column detection is hardened (does not map to Address Plan)
   - `server.js` contains `POST /api/sheets/append-record`
2) Create a tight, step-by-step staging test plan for re-enabling Add Record:
   - checkbox/dropdown inheritance validation
   - correct column placement (no address blob in Address Plan)
   - sorting + refresh behavior
   - multi-user stale-tab risk checks
3) Propose exact production rollout sequence:
   - pilot zone first, then broader rollout
   - clear rollback trigger criteria
4) Recommend short-term operating policy for captains until full row-ID architecture lands.
5) Then implement any needed code/test updates (if in agent/edit mode) and report findings clearly.

Important concerns:
- We have ~25 sheets in the wild.
- Need confidence sorting/filtering won’t silently corrupt data.
- Long-term plan is likely `resident_id` + `source_sheet_id` composite identity for rollups.
